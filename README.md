# FWI-Prediction-
Developed a machine learning model to predict Fire Weather Index (FWI) using weather parameters including RH, wind speed, rain, FFMC, DMC, ISI, class, and region, with data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and performance evaluation. This aimed to assess fire risk by modeling the relationship b/w weather conditions and fire indicators.
